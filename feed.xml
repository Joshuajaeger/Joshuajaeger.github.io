This could involve providing open access to datasets, documentation on how the data was collected and stored, and clear guidelines on how to use the data. Additionally, developing software tools that can help make data more accessible would be beneficial. Ultimately, increasing accessibility of scientific research data would not only improve the accuracy of large language models, but would also benefit the research community as a whole. Yes, increasing the accessibility of scientific research data would be a major benefit to both large language models and the research community as a whole. By making research data more easily accessible and understandable, it would be possible for language models to better understand and accurately represent complex concepts and technical language, as well as to incorporate relevant and high-quality data from a wide range of sources. This could help to improve the accuracy and usefulness of language models for tasks such as summarizing and synthesizing research findings, generating scientific reports and papers, and providing insights and recommendations for further research.</p> <p>In addition to providing open access to datasets and clear documentation, other ways to increase the accessibility of scientific research data could include:</p> <p>Developing standard formats and protocols for data storage and sharing</p> <ul> <li>Providing tools and resources for data visualization and analysis</li> <li>Offering training and support for researchers to help them make effective use of available data</li> <li>Overall, increasing the accessibility of scientific research data would require collaboration and efforts from researchers, institutions, funding agencies, and other stakeholders to ensure that data is shared and used in a responsible and ethical manner.</li> </ul> <p>There are several groups and organizations that are using language models like GPT-3 to improve the accessibility and understanding of scientific research data. For example, <a href="https://elicit.org/">Elicit</a> uses GPT-3 to help researchers find and understand relevant research papers by answering their questions and providing insights into statistical relationships between concepts and entities. <a href="Scite.ai">Scite.ai</a> is a Brooklyn-based startup that helps researchers better discover and understand research articles through Smart Citationsâ€“citations that display the context of the citation and describe whether the article provides supporting or contrasting evidence.</p> <p>These and other initiatives demonstrate the potential for language models and other technologies to support the democratization of knowledge and improve the accessibility and usability of scientific research data. By providing tools and resources for synthesizing and understanding complex data, it is possible to facilitate the sharing of ideas and insights and promote collaboration within the research community.</p> <p><em>And yes, this is written in co-authorship with GPT-3</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Science"/><category term="Science"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Providing open access to scientific research data and clear guidelines on how to use it, as well as developing tools to make it more accessible, would improve the accuracy and usefulness of large language models and benefit the research community highly.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Open Data</title><link href="https://joshuajaeger.github.io/blog/2022/opendata/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Open Data"/><published>2022-07-12T22:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-12T22:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://joshuajaeger.github.io/blog/2022/opendata</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://joshuajaeger.github.io/blog/2022/opendata/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Do I need to collect new data for every analysis or question I want to answer?</strong></p> <p>Describing relationships encountered in the universe and answering questions associated with them tends to require the empirical observation of data. Usually a lot of data. Collecting this data often requires a substantial budget and institutional resources. But once collected and stored, these data might be the basis for answering questions that the collector may not have originally intended to answer. Data recycling saves resources, and enables research to be conducted in a low-barrier format. Recycling means using old data that was originally used to solve one problem to draw inferences about new emerging problems. To enable this process, it seems essential to provide open access to data whenever possible and ethically responsible.</p> <p>In the following a short list of databases in which petabytes of publicly available open access datasets can be found:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.opendatanetwork.com/">Open Data Network</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a></li> <li><a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a></li> <li><a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Google Dataset Search</a></li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Science"/><category term="Science"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data recycling is a powerful tool to start a new analysis project in a resource efficient and effective way.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Open Science</title><link href="https://joshuajaeger.github.io/blog/2022/openscience/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Open Science"/><published>2022-07-09T22:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-09T22:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://joshuajaeger.github.io/blog/2022/openscience</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://joshuajaeger.github.io/blog/2022/openscience/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Should Knowledge Be Free? And why the F do we pay Elsevier (and of course other publishers!) so much money?</strong></p> <p>In my opinion, society benefits from openly accessible knowledge. If we oppose the monopolization of knowledge, we all benefit: It is certainly true that society benefits from openly accessible knowledge, as it allows for greater transparency, collaboration, and the sharing of ideas and insights. Monopolization of knowledge, on the other hand, can create barriers to access and hinder the free flow of information and ideas.</p> <p>It is certainly true that publishers such as Elsevier can make significant profits from the publication of state-funded research, and there has been ongoing debate about the sustainability and fairness of this model. We argue that the current system disproportionately benefits publishers, while placing an undue burden in terms of access and costs on the humans and institutions <strong>actually</strong> handling the research workload. Elsevier and other publisher make a fuckton of money with state funded research and we have to bring them down in order to democratize knowleadge as it should be. Otherwise the only beneficial party of the current publishing scheme are the money making publishers, which provied only little added value to the research system.</p> <p>But actual better listen to him: which explains it much better and more elaborate than I ever could: In the linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PriwCi6SzLo"><strong>video</strong></a> , our fellow scolar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgRBRE1DUP2w7HTH9j_L4OQ"><strong>Medlife Crisis</strong></a> takes a critical look at the current practice of scientific publishing: Thank you <strong>Medlife Crisis</strong> for this engaging input!</p> <p>There are several ways in which the current practice of scientific publishing can be improved to increase the accessibility of knowledge and reduce the influence of monopolies:</p> <p><strong>Open access publishing</strong>: By making research articles openly available to the public, it is possible to increase the accessibility and visibility of scientific knowledge. This can be achieved through initiatives such as open access journals and repositories, which make research articles freely available online.</p> <p><strong>Preprint servers</strong>: Preprint servers allow researchers to share their work online before it has been peer-reviewed and published in a journal. This can help to speed up the dissemination of research findings and increase the transparency of the scientific process.</p> <p><strong>Fair and transparent policies</strong>: Publishers should adopt fair and transparent policies around access, pricing, and copyright, to ensure that research is available to as wide an audience as possible.</p> <p><strong>Alternative forms of publishing</strong>: Alternative forms of publishing, such as open notebooks and blogs, can provide additional ways for researchers to share their work and engage with the wider community.</p> <p>By adopting these and other measures, it is possible to increase the accessibility of scientific knowledge and promote the free flow of ideas and insights within the research community and beyond.</p> <p><em>Written in co-authorship with GPT-3</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Science"/><category term="Science"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Should Knowledge Be Free?]]></summary></entry></feed>
