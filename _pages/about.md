I believe in the idea of the union between our collective tribal past and the promise of an enlightened and conscientious technological future. Merging the rational with the romantic.


As a PhD candidate at the University of Bern and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I seek to implement artificial intelligence in the field of clinical psychology. Together with my supervisors Maria Stein and Mark Hoogendoorn, I aim to understand how addiction disorders are constituted. The emphasis is on systematically identifying patterns of variables that are associated with symptom trajectories. 
The broad aim of our research is to provide an important step toward predictive analytics and personalized treatment planning in the field of substance use disorders. It is highly important, for both patients and clinicians, to have an accurate prognosis of symptom progression in order to make evidence-based decisions about the course of treatment. We are working to enable more accurate predictions to guide day-to-day clinical practice and support treatment-related decisions with data-driven and patient-centered models. Standing on the shoulders of giants, as a first step towards achieving this, we currently examine how state-of-the-art machine learning methods can be implemented to predict post-treatment relapse in patients with alcohol use disorders.

Apart from that, I love to build and experience thingsâ€”out of wood, with sounds and following patterns.
