I am PhD student at the University of Bern and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I am fascinated by the field that lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Clinical Psychology. In particular, I am interested in developing models to predict symptoms in addictive disorders. I aim to understand how addictions are constituted and what variables influence their trajectory.
