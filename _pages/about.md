[**Ektoplazm**](https://ektoplazm.com/) asked me once: If I believe in the idea of a union between our collective tribal past and the promise of an enlightened and conscientious technological future—merging the rational with the romantic... and boy do I.

As a Ph.D. student at the University of Bern and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I seek to implement artificial intelligence systems in the field of clinical psychology. Together with my supervisors Maria Stein and Mark Hoogendoorn, we aim to understand how addiction disorders are constituted. The emphasis is on systematically identifying patterns of variables that are associated with symptom trajectories. 
The broad aim of our research is to provide an important step toward predictive analytics and personalized treatment planning in the field of substance use disorders. We are working to enable more accurate predictions to guide day-to-day clinical practice and support treatment-related decisions with data-driven and patient-centered models. 

Apart from that, I mostly love anything slightly related to building and experiencing entities—out of wood, sound, and patterns.
