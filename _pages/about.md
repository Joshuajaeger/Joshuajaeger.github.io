I believe in the idea of the union between our collective tribal past and the promise of an enlightened and conscientious technological future. Merging the rational with the romantic.


I am PhD student at the University of Bern and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I am fascinated by the field that lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Clinical Psychology. I aim to understand how addictions are constituted and what variables influence their trajectory. In my research, I investigate addiction disorders, particularly alcohol use disorders, and seek to understand and utilize machine learning to predict symptom progression and systematically identify patterns. When I'm not working on that, I try to use space and time to create noise that is intended to build a sense of cohesion in those around me.

Basically, I like to build thingsâ€”out of wood, out of sounds, and based on data.
