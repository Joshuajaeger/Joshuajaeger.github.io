> «Have we taken something seriously that we should have just played with, or was it the other way around?»

The world is constantly evolving and facing new challenges. By working together, we have the power to make positive changes and help create a future in which as many conscious beings feel well. However, it's also important that we recognize and address the potential risks that come with these changes in order to create a safer and more sustainable world.

**Effective altruism** is a philosophy and social movement that aims to use evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways of realocating resources on a personal and group level, and to take action based on that evidence. Its is a way of thinking about how to use time, money, and other resources to provide support in the most effective way. It involves using evidence and careful analysis to figure out the best ways to enable a positive difference, given the limited resources we have available.

One way that individuals can get involved in effective altruism is through the [**_Giving Pledge_**](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge). This is a commitment by individuals to donate at least 10% of their income to effective charitable causes. The Giving Pledge is inspired by the principles of effective altruism, which emphasize the importance of maximizing the impact of charitable donations. 

While taking the Giving Pledge is a personal decision, it can be a powerful way to make a difference and to support effective charitable causes. One should be aware that this decision is a matter of elevated privilege. The right and well-being of our planet and the individuals living on it should not be subject to the personal preferences and decisions of a few privileged individuals who have more resources than they need. However, under the given circumstances, the political and social system, this seems to be unavoidable.

[**The Science in Exile Declaration—supporting at-risk, displaced, and refugee scientists—A call to action**](https://www.interacademies.org/publication/science-exile-declaration-supporting-risk-displaced-and-refugee-scientists-call-action) outlines key commitments necessary at global level for both immediate and long-term support and protection to scholars and scientists who are at-risk, displaced or refugees, so as to build a better future for them, science and society at large.

If you would like to become active, you might consider [**_signing the declaration_**](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Uq5PHbM5-kuwswIpVrERlLxCIrq-PktOpQTRI0lHzktUNlJPNEtNVzgzWThYWEFRS0NGQkFPMlFMRi4u).

As part of the scientific community it seems obvious to support and actively welcome fellow scholars and scientists who are at-risk, displaced, or refugees and I believe this is an important and necessery step. 
However, it is important to note that this does not imply that this support may be reserved for this circle of people, but should be granted to all conscious beings. 


I share those information because I feel it is important to see them represented on my home planet. The sharing of such information always has the flavor of bragging about one's own good deeds:  There is a valid argument that sharing information about good deeds can come across as bragging and self-promotion. Some people may feel that others are sharing this information in order to receive praise and attention, rather than simply wanting to spread awareness about a cause or inspire others to take action.
One argument in favor of sharing information about good deeds is that it can inspire and motivate others to also take action and do good in the world. When people hear about others doing good, it can make them feel more positive and hopeful about the world, and may encourage them to also get involved in causes that they care about. In this way, sharing information about good deeds can have a ripple effect, with one person's actions inspiring others to take action.


**In reference to Aldous Huxley:**

> «I am almost embarrassed. But after all the decades of searching, after all the scientific, spiritual, and psychological paths I have encountered, after all the numerous great masters I have been privileged to meet, I have come to the following conclusion: The most powerful and beneficial practice is probably to encounter oneself, other human and conscious beings, and the entire universe in a Humble and benign way.»
