**Alcohol use disorders, selected and innovative aspects of treatment**

Conducted in collaboration with PD Dr. Maria Stein

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most common mental disorders, immensely affecting the quality of life of those affected and their families, and leading to significant societal costs. With substantial relapse rates despite specialized treatment programs, research and practice continue to seek innovative ways to improve therapeutic outcomes.
In addition to a brief introduction to classification and ethology and a broad overview of AUD treatment in general, the seminar will focus in-depth on selected or innovative aspects of addiction treatment.
A preliminary focus will be on motivational interviewing. After elaborating the theoretical background, we will deepen this approach by specifically reflecting on interactions between therapist and client. We will focus on skills training, which is another established therapy component. As innovative, currently researched aspects, we will consider the potential of psychedelic agents in the therapy of addictive disorders. Furthermore, we will deal with computerized training methods that aim to change dysfunctional cognitive processes in patients with AUD under the keyword of cognitive bias modification.
We will conclude with a discussion on the quantification and statistical challenges faced when researching AUD.

Modalities of the assessment: Students are asked to participate in the organization of a seminar. Secondly, each participant will hold a so-called "3-minute-presentation". In this case, one slide will be used to present a self-selected aspect (deepening, expansion, justified commentary) from the seminar content within 3 minutes. Half of the grade is based on the grade for the seminar presentation and the other half on the grade for the "3-minute-presentation". Oral participation can lead to an increase or decrease of the overall grade.

**How to measure Addiction?**

Addiction is a condition that changes and affects lives in a wide variety of areas.
Quantifying the severity of this multifaceted impairment is difficult, but highly relevant for research as well as for day-to-day clinical practice.
In a literature thesis, methods of how to measure addiction are to be elaborated.
It is expected that the current state of research is reflected and presented in a literature paper.
The specific scope of the thesis can be elaborated bilaterally and should reflect the student's interests.
The thesis can be written in German or English.

**Predictors of Alcohol Use Disorder**

Alcohol use disorder is a clinical condition that often accompanies patients throughout their lives.
Predicting the development of symptoms is particularly difficult, as alcohol use disorders have a highly individual course.
However, there are variables that have been suggested as predictors of AUD.
In a literature thesis, these variables are to be elaborated and summarized.
It is expected that the current state of research is reflected and presented in a literature paper.
The specific scope of the thesis can be elaborated bilaterally and should reflect the student's interests.
The thesis can be written in German or English.

**Machine Learning in the Field of Addiction Research.**

Machine learning is an emerging and rapidly evolving data-driven method for exploring and predicting specific patterns and variables. It promises to provide new insights and more accurate predictions of disease progression in a research domain that is multicausal and multivariate, such as addiction research.

The specific scope of the thesis may be developed bilaterally and should reflect the interests of the student.
It is expected that the current state of research is reflected and presented in a literature thesis.

**Recent methods and approaches to the treatment of substance use disorders.**

Despite many established treatment options for substance use disorders, the risk of relapse remains high and recovery status is difficult to achieve for many patients. New methods and approaches to treating substance use disorders and supporting patients are therefore needed and in demand.

The specific scope of the thesis can be elaborated bilaterally and should reflect the student's interests, e.g., regarding the type of treatment (pharmaceutical, behavioral approaches) or regarding substance-specific addiction (alcohol, opioids,...).
